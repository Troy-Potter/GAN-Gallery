# SWEN Semester Project - GAN-Gallery

This project implemented the PyTorch Machine Learning framework to create pictures. All images were scraped from wikiart after we couldn't
figure out how to use their confusing API. The program will take in random noise and output images generated. By the end of the semester 
my partner and I had gotten to training the loop where we ran into issues. One of those issues included the generator producing repetitive images midway through the loop.
