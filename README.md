# SWEN Semester Project - GAN-Gallery

This project implemented the PyTorch Machine Learning framework to create pictures. The program will take in random noise and output images generated. Once an image is generated it will compare with real pictures scraped from wikiart and determine its adversarial loss.   By the end of the semester my partner and I had gotten to training the loop where we ran into issues. One of those issues included the generator producing repetitive images midway through the loop.
